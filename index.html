        <h1>About Will Bohmann</h1>
        <p>At the core, I am a pure constructivist. I believe that new learning builds on prior knowledge. We remember
          that which we experience, the events we make connections to and are engaged in. Real learning is not just in
          the
          telling and doing.
          Deep learning comes from recalling and reflecting. I believe we make meaning from the environment around us.
          It
          is imperative that educators set up that environment for success to facilitate deep connections.</p>
        <p>I've been working in the field of education for over twenty five years. If there is one constant it is that
          people are well adapted to learning. The role of the teacher is to help students realize their full potential
          as
          a learner.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working as an educator, I like to get outdoors. Vermont is a great place to pve in all seasons.
          My favorite activities include running the backroads, hiking in the Green Mountains and biking the trail
          networks
          near my house. I also enjoy cooking and hanging out with my family.</p>

        <h4>Tech and Common Core</h4>
        <p>When one takes the time to look at the language of Common Core Standards, words such as analyze, evaluate,
          engage, produce, collaborate, and interpret require students to go beyond a basic understanding of content.
          Learners are expected to move into higher order problem-solving, decisionmaking, and creative application of
          content knowledge in order to prove mastery of the standards using technology.

        <h4>Equity in Education</h4>
        <p>The term “equity in education” is deeply complex and can take on many forms, making it challenging to
          establish a succinct definition. But the basic meaning behind the term is the pursuit of creating an
          educational system that caters to students of all kinds and develops their educational experience accordingly.
